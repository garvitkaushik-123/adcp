/**
 * Per-user Anthropic API cost cap (#2790).
 *
 * Tool-call frequency limits (#2784, #2789) bound OUR external API
 * spend (Google Docs, Gemini, Slack) but don't bound Anthropic spend.
 * Each Addie turn is a Claude API call, and an attacker with a
 * compromised account can keep a session running that stays under
 * the tool-call cap while steadily burning dollars on Claude.
 *
 * This module enforces a rolling 24-hour USD budget per user at the
 * claude-client boundary. Callers check the cap at entry, record
 * cost on completion. Like `tool-rate-limiter.ts`, it uses a
 * dependency-injection seam so unit tests don't need a Postgres
 * connection.
 *
 * System users (automated pipelines — newsletter, registry review)
 * are exempt by literal allowlist (see `./system-identities.ts`).
 * Router-layer Claude calls (Haiku for routing decisions) are also
 * exempt because they aren't user-initiated; the cost there is
 * amortized across the workspace.
 *
 * Known trade-offs:
 *
 * - **Check/record race.** The flow is `check → Claude call → record`,
 *   which is TOCTOU. N concurrent requests from one user can all see
 *   the same stale sum and all pass. Worst case a user overshoots
 *   the cap by a factor equal to their concurrency (10 parallel
 *   streams at member_free ≈ $50 instead of $5). Acceptable given
 *   this is a cost-defense gate, not an account-freeze, and the
 *   overshoot self-limits within one window.
 *
 * - **Recording-failure tolerance.** `recordCost` catches DB write
 *   errors and logs them — a sustained DB outage quietly disables
 *   the cap. Alternative behavior (fail the response when we can't
 *   record) would cause user-visible outages from an accounting-layer
 *   issue; logging loudly + alerting on sustained failures is the
 *   documented fallback.
 *
 * - **Charges record even on flagged / truncated responses.** The
 *   tokens went to Anthropic whether or not we liked the result, so
 *   the cost accumulates. Avoids a bypass where an attacker
 *   intentionally triggers truncation to make responses "free".

/**
 * Per-user daily budgets in USD micros. Tier-aware so anonymous /
 * Explorer users get a smaller ceiling than paying members.
 *
 * Rationales:
 * - `anonymous`: $3/day. Sized to slightly exceed the per-IP message
 *   rate limit (50/day) at the current Sonnet ~$0.05/turn rate, so the
 *   message-count cap binds first for a legitimate user and the dollar
 *   cap only fires on scripted abuse. Was $1 when anonymous chat was
 *   on Haiku (~$0.01/turn → ~100 turns/day, well above rate limit);
 *   bumped on the Haiku→Sonnet move so legit users don't hit the
 *   dollar ceiling at ~20 turns.
 * - `member_free`: $5/day. Free tier with an account — slightly more
 *   trust than anonymous, same floor a real user couldn't reach in
 *   a day of genuine conversational use.
 * - `member_paid`: $25/day. Paying members get a generous ceiling
 *   that's still a real cap — a runaway automated session still
 *   trips it within an hour of sustained abuse.
 * - `aao_team`: uncapped. AAO staff/admin/team users are operating
 *   the service, not consuming member benefits, so they should not
 *   hit a self-service spend ceiling while doing support or admin work.
